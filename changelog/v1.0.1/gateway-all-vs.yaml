  - type: FIX
    description: >
      Issue #1142 was completed without providing an escape hatch to return to the old behavior. Add a field
      `readAllVirtualServices` on the HttpGateway proto message to allow reading all virtual services from
      all watched namespaces. The ways to link a virtual service to a Gateway are now: 1) provide a selector
      to find virtual services in the same namespace as the Gateway controller with the given labels, or
      2) explicitly specify Virtual Services by providing a list of resource refs, or 3) set
      `readAllVirtualServices` to true, in which case all Virtual Services in all watched namespaces will be
      read.
