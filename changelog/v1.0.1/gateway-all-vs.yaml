changelog:
  - type: FIX
    description: >
      Issue #1142 was completed without providing an escape hatch to return to the old behavior. Add a field
      `selectFromNamespaces` on the HttpGateway proto message to specify which of the watched namespaces to
      read Virtual Services from. The field defaults to empty, in which case the behavior is to process
      VirtualServices from all watched namespaces. It is an error to provide a Virtual Service ref
      in the `virtualServices` field with a namespace not included in Gloo's watch namespaces.
