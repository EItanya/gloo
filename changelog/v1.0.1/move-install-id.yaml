changelog:
  - type: FIX
    description: >
      Move installationId Helm value out of `globals`. This is necessary because of the fact that the `globals` map
      gets *copied* between a chart and its subchart, so the mutation that's necessary to guarantee uniqueness of
      the installationId isn't respected between the two charts.
