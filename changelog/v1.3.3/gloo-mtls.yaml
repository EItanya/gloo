  - type: HELM
    description: >
      Enable MTLS authentication in between Gloo and Envoy. Introduces the new Helm setting
      "global.glooMtls.enabled", "global.glooMtls.tlsKey", and "global.glooMtls.tlsCert".
      An example of a helm override file that enables MTLS authentication with self-signed certs is:
      ```
      global:
        glooMtls:
          enabled: true
            tlsKey: <secret>
            tlsCert: <secret>
      ```
